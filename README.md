This is somewhat simplified - especially the calculation of the parameter *a* - as a lot of the linear algebra stuff in that paper is way over my head. But the end result is very similar, and the general process is the same.

This is specifically made for Fake FCS results, but it's probably easy to adapt it to other datasets.
